## Differences between HTML and JSX
1. The use of 'class' and 'for' in HTML but 'className' and 'HTMLFor' in JSX
2. Only a single parent element may be returned in JSX. HTML has no such restrictions.
3. JavaScript may be implemented directly in JSX. HTML does not have the capability to implement JavaScript directly.
4. All tags are self0closing in JSX, and thay must have a closing slash (/). Not all HTML tags are self-closing, and the closing slash is optional.

## Why can browsers not read JSX?
Browser engines are not implemented to read JSX because JSX is not valid JavaScript. Browsers need a trannspiler like 'Babel' to understand JSX.
